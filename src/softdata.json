One of the biggest challenges during development was maintaining the <strong>product customization and pricing module</strong>. I have created a separate component for the customization and called API based on the product by that I handled the <strong>customization and pricing part in Node JS API</strong>.

One of the biggest challenges during development was maintaining the <strong>product customization and pricing module</strong>. I have created a separate component for the customization and called API based on the product by that I handled the <strong>customization and pricing part in Node JS API</strong>. I <strong>learned</strong> many new things while building this project still I am getting new changes and new phases to work on.",
